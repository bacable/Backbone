This is my Monogame library that I've been developing alongside my next Proximity game.

Anything that I think is reusable I try to put into here and keep generic and reusable in future games as best as I can.

Some highlights of whats in here:
- Many GUI components I use in the game
- Many Menu components I use in the game
- A robust action and animation system modeled after Apple's Spritekit (but supports 3D)
- Basic and incomplete wrapper for Steam integration
- Basic and incomplete wrapper for Twitch integration

While I tried to make this useful for other people, this is first and foremost focused on supporting the development of my Proximity game right now, so it's not super user-friendly and I don't have public examples built. This is utilized heavily in my game, however, so it does work, even if it is a little sloppy and very incomplete in some places.
